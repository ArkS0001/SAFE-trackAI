## Prompt
Explain quantum physics like I'm five.

## Response
Okay, imagine everything is made of tiny, tiny LEGO bricks, much smaller than you can even see! That’s kind of like quantum physics. 

Here’s the tricky part:

* **Things aren’t always in one place:** Normally, LEGOs are in one spot, right? But tiny LEGO bricks can be *kind of* in multiple places *at the same time*! It’s like they’re blurry and vibrating, showing up in different places until you look at them. That's called “superposition.”

* **They only decide where they are when you look:**  When you try to see if a LEGO brick is in one spot, it suddenly picks a spot!  It's not blurry, it just *chooses* to be there.  It’s like it’s shy and only reveals itself when you ask a question.

* **They can jump around:** Sometimes, LEGOs can wiggle and jump from one spot to another really, really fast! That's called “quantum tunneling.” It's like they're magic and can pop through walls!

* **They're connected even if they're far apart:**  Imagine you have two LEGO bricks, and you wind up one on your side of the room and the other on your friend’s side. They're still connected, even though they're far away! Quantum physics says tiny things can be connected in a way we don’t fully understand.

**It's a bit weird, and scientists are still figuring it out!**  But that's the basic idea – everything is made of tiny, blurry, and sometimes magical LEGOs that can be in multiple places at once until we look at them.

**Do you want to know more about how tiny things behave?**  We could talk about things like rainbows or how light works!
